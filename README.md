# Fibonacci Sequence in RISC-V  
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>   

These are recursion experiments in RISC-V assembler based on the Fibonacci
sequence. They were tested with the RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator
(RARS) from https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars . To use, download the stable
release and run with 

        java -jar rars-<NUMBER>.jar 

under Linux.
